v0.1.0, 2014.01.19 -- Initial release.
v1.0.0, 2014.05.12 -- version 1.0 release; abstracted grid creation from filters.
v1.0.1, 2015.07.26 -- Moved some functions into "plotting" submodule of psyutils.image. Only use freeimage plugin to save 16 bit images; otherwise defaults to scikit-image default plugin. Commented run_tests.sh since this didn't work as intended. Just call nosetests in my normal env for now. Added a dirty hack function to plot orientations.
----- somehow missed some version numbers relative to setup.py. oops.
v1.1.3,  2016.01.27 -- new psydata module, with some common helper functions for dealing with psychophysical data. Pretty hacky and mostly untested.
v1.1.4, 2016.02.04 -- bug fix; chance level not correct when gamma != .5.
v1.2.1, 2016.08.08 -- new feature in image module to do spectral analysis. Plot power spectrum as a function of spatial frequency and orientation. Added some new test images.
v1.3.1, 2016.08.10 -- updated spectral analysis functions to use more sensible smooth (Gaussian) sliding windows rather than hard-edged windows. Also allow passing a custom random number generator to filtered noise function, and a "symmetric" argument for the orientation gaussian, and a second mode for angular axes.
v1.3.2, 2017.12.30 -- some bug fixes to update testing. Getting Travis for CI working.
v1.3.3, 2018.01.05 -- updated ignored files.
v2.0.0, 2018.07.11 -- breaking backwards compatibility by removing psydata module (now I fit my data in R; not needed). File kept for posterity. Moved expand_grid function to misc. Other changes include wrapping matplotlib in try loops because currently on OSX matplotlib breaks due to backend problem.
